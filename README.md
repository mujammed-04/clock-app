## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

For static export (GitHub Pages):

```bash
npm run build:static
```

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Static Export)

The project is configured for GitHub Pages deployment with static export. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build and deploy to GitHub Pages when you push to the main branch.

**Requirements:**

- Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
- Set the source to "GitHub Actions"

### Vercel (SSR Support)

For server-side rendering support, deploy to Vercel:

1. Connect your repository to Vercel
2. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
    - `VERCEL_TOKEN`
    - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
    - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
3. Use the `ci-cd-vercel.yml` workflow

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
